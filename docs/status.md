# Implementation status

## Implemented starter pieces

- Golden Daylight app shell ([issue #16](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/issues/16)): design tokens with light and proposed dark themes, locally bundled Inter and Lucide icons, sidebar navigation (Home, Files, Organize, Graph, Ask & Act, Model Lab), a global search field with a platform-aware ⌘K / Ctrl K shortcut, a document panel with Summary, Details and Related tabs, and shared button, badge, panel, list row, empty state, notice, modal and progress components. The starter `App.tsx` presentation and `src/styles.css` are retired. Summaries, Ask & Act, collections, renames and Model Lab show honest "not available yet" states; nothing is presented as AI output or a saved change.
- Olio mascot artwork: twelve cleaned poses bundled in `src/assets/olio/`. Home's header pose follows the file list (default, confused for no results, peeking for an empty folder). The Files empty states, Organize's empty Collections and Model Lab's "no model" state also show a pose. The wordmark is still interim text.
- A sidebar theme switch (System, Light, Dark), remembered on the device, and coloured file-type tiles in file lists and the document panel. Checked in headless Chromium: the switch cycles, the choice survives a reload, and System removes the override. The sample files are all Markdown, so the PDF and text tiles have not been seen rendered.
- File table and reader ([issue #17](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/issues/17)): name, location, type, modified and size columns that drop to fit the space; the reader beside the table (or in place of it below 860px) shows the file's text as read-only, with its full path. The reader never shows a file the current list excludes. In the desktop app, Folio starts with an "Add folder" state (sample files on request); an added folder with no readable files offers "Choose another folder". The browser preview lists sample files and says so.
- Shared error and recovery states ([issue #18](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/issues/18)): every error code maps to one plain-language message and next step ([error-states.md](error-states.md)), shown through one recovery notice in every workflow. Drafts (the Ask & Act request, rename names per file) survive errors and view changes. Success after opening a folder is shown only once the native core reports it. Each view announces into its own live region. Modals keep Tab inside them. A browser-only practice mode (`?simulate=<code>`) triggers each state in its own flow.
- Keyword filtering (explicitly labelled), actual Markdown-link discovery in fixture text, source content views, and a list of those explicit links with their evidence (Graph view).
- Tauri folder picker and scoped native listing/TXT/Markdown reading commands.
- [Frozen cross-track contracts](contracts.md) declared in both `src/domain/contracts.ts` and `src-tauri/src/contracts.rs`: typed failures, stable workspace/document identity, UTF-8 source offsets bound to a document revision, typed relationship evidence, embedding-space fingerprints, provider error/cancellation codes, plans, approvals, per-operation outcomes, history and undo shapes.
- Native commands that return `{ code, message, details? }` instead of prose, a workspace registry that refuses an identity it never issued, listing that reports files it cannot identify instead of renaming them, and reads that return the document's content hash.
- A native plan registry that issues plan identities and digests, binds approval to the exact digest, and runs read-only preflight over the real filesystem. `apply_plan` refuses with `writerNotImplemented`; no native write exists.
- Deterministic batch-outcome rules (succeeded/failed/cancelled/notStarted), whole-batch Undo conflict preflight, and restart handling that drops approvals, in both languages.
- Cross-language golden fixtures in `fixtures/contracts/` that pin hashes, identities, path rules, offsets, fingerprints and canonical plan bytes for the TypeScript and Rust suites.
- Configuration guards asserting the webview capability grants no filesystem, shell, HTTP or dialog permission and that the CSP allows no remote origin.
- A SQLite migration contract.
- Fifteen English/Filipino/Taglish synthetic text documents and labelled benchmark cases.
- Product docs, glossary, ADRs, four-person plan, and CI definitions.
- Golden Daylight design system and Olio mascot rules recorded in [design.md](design.md); not yet implemented in the UI. The dark theme and its contrast ratios are computed, not visually reviewed, and the Olio poses and wordmark SVG are still to be produced.

## Native workspace and index (issue #3)

- SQLite in the OS app-data directory (`folio.sqlite`), migrated through `PRAGMA user_version`; WAL mode, so scans run on their own connection.
- Folders chosen in the native picker are remembered and can be reopened by id; reopening is refused when the folder is gone, unreadable or resolves elsewhere (ADR 0007).
- Incremental scan of TXT, Markdown and text-based PDFs (per page, via `lopdf`). Size+mtime, then SHA-256, decide whether a file is re-read. Hidden folders, `node_modules` and symlinks are skipped. Progress events, cancellation between files, batches of 50.
- Scanned/image-only PDFs are `unsupported`; unreadable new files are `failed`; a changed file that cannot be re-read keeps its previous chunks and is marked `stale`. `stale` and `failed` documents are re-read on every scan, so a file that was locked, offline or briefly unreadable recovers once it can be read.
- A folder or file that cannot be read during a scan is not treated as deleted: records at or below it keep their data and status. Only files that are really gone are removed.
- Each batch reads, hashes and extracts its files before opening the write transaction, so other writes (remembering a folder, storing vectors) are not blocked behind PDF extraction.
- PDF object, cross-reference and page streams are each bounded at 16 MiB of decompressed data while loading and extracting, so a decompression bomb is dropped rather than allocated. A page whose text cannot be extracted is skipped and named in the document's status message; a PDF whose pages all fail is `failed`, not reported as a scan.
- Changed or deleted documents drop their chunks, vectors, relationships and cached summaries. Markdown-link relationships are rebuilt with located link evidence.
- FTS5 keyword search across unopened documents, returning document id, path and excerpt as `utf8Byte` passages bound to the indexed revision (`documentContentHash`), with page numbers for PDFs. Labelled `keyword`.
- Follows the [frozen contract](contracts.md): `workspaceId:relativePath` document ids, `sha256:` hashes, `explicitReference` relationships with the raw and resolved link, `folio-space-v1/...` space fingerprints, and `{ code, message, details }` failures. `read_document` now also returns the extracted text of text-based PDFs.
- Exact-duplicate groups are confirmed by comparing the files byte for byte in blocks, so files of any size are verified; the comparison runs without holding the index.
- Embedding store for the provider track: registered spaces keyed by model/revision/quantization/dimensions/preprocessing, per-space pending-chunk listing, vector storage with dimension checks, and exact cosine search within one space only. A vector is stored only while its chunk still holds the text it was computed from (`contentHash`), because chunk ids can be reused after a rescan. No embedding model is connected.

## Pending

Multilingual embedding integration, semantic search, model lifecycle/downloads, local generation, AI summaries, command interpretation, shared-fact discovery, durable apply/undo/history, UI use of the native index (the current UI still searches loaded content), live file watching, multi-folder workspaces, and real Model Lab results.

The native writer is [issue #5](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/issues/5). Until it lands, no file has ever been written by Folio. The cases that need it are listed as pending, not mocked: 16 `todo` cases in `src/domain/pending.test.ts` and three `#[ignore]` tests in `src-tauri/src/plan.rs`. Interface and contract tests are not filesystem apply/undo evidence.

No AI or save completion should be presented until the corresponding native/provider implementation succeeds. Model sizes, installed size, memory targets, and platform support remain subject to measurements.

## Verification

### Error and recovery states (2026-10-09, issue #18)

Checked on macOS with Node.js 26.10.0:

- `npm run format:check`, `npm run check` and `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm test`: 120 passed, 16 todo. The new cases:
  - every error code has a title, a message and a flow;
  - the wording contains no developer terms or code names;
  - refused changes say no file was changed;
  - model failures say the request is kept;
  - a code this build doesn't know falls back to the general message;
  - action state: success only from the native success of the pending request, never before; late replies to older requests are ignored, and a failure can't be overwritten;
  - practice mode is never active in the desktop app.
- Browser preview in headless Google Chrome via Playwright at 1280×850, once per code with `?simulate=<code>` (all 33):
  - each message appears in its flow with the expected next-step button;
  - danger messages are `role="alert"`, and the others reach the view's live region;
  - the typed rename name and the Ask & Act request are still there afterwards, including after Open Model Lab and back;
  - no rename preview opens on a refused change.
- Without practice mode:
  - there's no banner, and Add folder stays disabled in the browser;
  - an Ask & Act message is announced in the Ask & Act region, and that region is gone after switching to Organize;
  - in the rename preview, 8 Tabs and 8 Shift+Tabs stay inside the dialog, and Escape closes it and returns focus to Preview rename;
  - the rendered text of all six views contains none of "Track T…", "docs/", "engine", "adapter", "fixture", "payload", "null" or "undefined".

Not verified: real native failures (only simulated ones), the folder-opened success message (it needs the native folder picker), screen readers, and the Tauri webview.

### File table and reader (2026-10-09, issue #17)

Checked on macOS with Node.js 26.10.0:

- `npm run format:check`, `npm run check` and `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm test`: 104 passed, 16 todo. The new cases cover which document the reader and Organize may use: nothing until a file is chosen, never a file the current search excludes, files opened from Graph, and none in Organize or Ask & Act.
- Browser preview in headless Google Chrome via Playwright, at 1280×850, 1024×768, 700×800, and 640×425 at device scale 2:
  - nothing is selected or opened at startup;
  - at 1280 and 1024 the table and the reader are both on the first screen, and with the reader open the table keeps Name, Location and Modified;
  - at 700px and 200% zoom the reader replaces the table, Back returns to it with focus on the row, and there's no horizontal scroll or clipped heading;
  - the open row has `aria-selected="true"` and a spoken name with its location, type, date and size;
  - a long Filipino/Taglish file name and folder path injected into a row truncate with an ellipsis, without page overflow, and the row's tooltip carries the full path;
  - a search that excludes the open file closes the reader, and clearing the search brings it back;
  - after review: with that search active, Organize offers only the matching files instead of a rename form for the hidden one (open `project-plan.md`, search "budget", go to Organize → only `budget-notes.md` is offered);
  - the reader shows the contents with a Read-only badge, the full path, and the source ("Sample file bundled with Folio").
- Desktop no-folder state, simulated in the browser by setting the flag the Tauri API reads: Home and Files show Olio with "Add folder" and "Look at sample files", and the latter lists the 15 samples under "Showing sample files".

Not verified: the real Tauri webview, native folder picking, a real folder with no readable files (the empty-folder state was not rendered), text-PDF pages (PDF text extraction doesn't exist yet, so the reader says so), screen readers, and column sorting (not built). Sample files have no modification time, so their Modified column shows "—".

### App shell and design tokens (2026-10-09, issue #16)

Checked on macOS with Node.js 26.10.0:

- `npm run format:check`, `npm run check` and `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm test`: 90 passed, 16 todo. The new cases cover the platform-aware search shortcut and the navigation keeping Organize separate from Ask & Act.
- Browser preview (sample fixtures only) in headless Google Chrome via Playwright at 1280×850 (light and dark), 1024×768, 700×800, and 640×425 at device scale 2 (200% zoom of 1280×850):
  - no horizontal page scroll;
  - Inter loaded from the bundle;
  - smallest rendered text 12px;
  - at 1280 and 1024 the file list and the selected document's panel are both on the first screen;
  - at 700px and 200% zoom the document replaces the list, with a Back control.
- Keyboard checks in the same run:
  - ⌘K focuses search on macOS, and Ctrl+K is ignored there;
  - arrow keys move between file rows and between document tabs;
  - the active nav item has `aria-current="page"`;
  - Escape closes the rename preview and returns focus to its trigger.

Follow-up after the #25 design review, checked the same way at 1280×850 and 700×600:

- the dark tokens match `docs/design.md`;
- Escape closes the document panel and returns focus to the row that opened it;
- only one file row is in the Tab order, and arrow keys move between rows;
- at 700×600 the Home title is visually hidden but still a heading for screen readers, and six file rows are on the first screen;
- picking a folder before the sample files finish loading can no longer show the samples as that folder (code fix; there's no DOM test environment to cover it automatically).

Second review round on PR #26, checked the same way (headless Chrome, sample fixtures) at 1280×850, 700×800 and 640×425 at device scale 2:

- with a document open at 700px and 200% zoom, the search field and notices stay visible above it, ⌘K focuses search, opening a document moves focus to its heading, and there's no horizontal scroll;
- Organize no longer opens the reader; the rename form stays visible with a "Choose a different file" control, and the typed name is cleared when the file changes;
- Escape in the search field clears it without closing the document; Escape elsewhere still closes it and returns focus to its row;
- following a Related link moves focus to the new document's heading;
- the list's single Tab stop follows the arrow-key focus;
- startup shows "Loading files…" instead of the empty-folder message;
- non-error notices are announced through one always-present live region (DOM check only; not tested with a screen reader);
- with reduced motion, the indeterminate progress bar is a still, half-opaque fill;
- `npm test`: 92 passed, 16 todo, adding cases for the search shortcut on Cyrillic, Greek and Dvorak layouts.

Not verified: Ctrl K on Windows (unit-tested only), screen readers, the Tauri webview, native folder picking, and the dark theme's visual review. Contrast follows the measured token pairs in `docs/design.md`; no automated contrast audit was run on rendered pages.

### Contract freeze and safety baseline (2026-10-09, issue #2)

Checked on Linux (WSL2) with Node.js 24.15.0, npm 11.12.1 and cargo 1.95.0:

- `npm run format:check`: passed.
- `npm run check`: passed.
- `npm test`: 85 tests passed, 16 explicitly pending (`todo`), across identity, UTF-8 offsets, typed failures and unknown-code handling, keyword retrieval over the synthetic corpus, typed relationship evidence, plan preflight/digest/approval, batch outcomes, whole-batch undo and the cross-language fixtures.
- `npm run build`: passed; the production frontend compiles.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: 75 passed, 3 ignored (the pending native-writer cases). Covers folder escape and symlink escape against temporary synthetic folders, the workspace gate, non-Unicode filenames, byte lengths, plan digest forgery, stale and fabricated approvals, rename collision with the existing file read back unchanged, case-insensitive target aliases, batch-failure and cancellation outcomes, undo conflicts, the capability/CSP guards, and the shared contract fixtures.

The native count differs by platform, because some fixtures can only exist on some systems. Symbolic links are exercised on Unix. A filename that is not valid UTF-8 can only be created where the filesystem stores arbitrary bytes — macOS refuses it at creation, and Windows filenames are UTF-16 — so the listing case that reports such a file as skipped runs only there; the refusal itself is covered on every platform by a filesystem-free test. A file whose name contains a backslash can only exist where backslash is not the path separator, so that identity case is Unix-only, while the separator-ambiguity refusal is checked everywhere.

`src-tauri/Cargo.lock` is committed so these runs are reproducible; it references only crates.io and contains no host paths or credentials. `fixtures/contracts/contract-cases.json` is reproduced byte for byte by `fixtures/contracts/generate-contract-cases.py`.

The Node checks were run from a disposable copy of this repository placed outside the home directory, and `cargo test` was run in place. Both ran on one Linux (WSL2) host; neither is evidence about any other platform. A pre-existing zero-byte `/home/tj/package.json` on this host breaks esbuild's config loader for every Vite project under that tree; it belongs to the host, not to Folio, and was left untouched. The same scripts run unchanged in CI.

### GitHub Actions on this branch

[Run 37934419707](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/actions/runs/37934419707), for commit `5339690` on [PR #13](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/pull/13): the frontend job passed; both `desktop-check` jobs failed. macOS could not create a filename that is not valid UTF-8 ("Illegal byte sequence"), and Windows could not create a file whose name contains a backslash, because there it is the path separator. Both were test fixtures assuming the host's filesystem, not defects in the code under test; the surrounding assertions passed on every platform. The fixtures are now scoped to the systems that can hold them, and the refusals they checked are covered everywhere by filesystem-free tests.

[Run 37935515689](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/actions/runs/37935515689), for commit `fab1680`, passed all three jobs: frontend, `desktop-check (macos-latest)` with 74 native tests passed and 3 ignored, and `desktop-check (windows-latest)` with 70 passed and 3 ignored. The counts differ from the 75 on Linux exactly by the fixtures each platform cannot hold — macOS lacks the one needing a filename that is not valid UTF-8 on disk, and Windows also lacks the four needing symbolic links or a backslash in a filename, while gaining its own UTF-16 version of the non-Unicode refusal.

These are results for the native test suite only. No desktop startup, folder picker, installer, bundle or local inference has been exercised on Windows or macOS, and CI does not do so. Issue #2 stays open until that evidence exists.

Not verified by this work, and not claimed: desktop startup and the native folder picker on actual Windows and macOS, any native file write, undo against real files, installers or bundles, local inference, and installed size, memory or responsiveness budgets. Issue #2 stays open until real Windows and macOS startup and folder-picker evidence exists.

### Documentation and starter baseline (2026-10-09)

Checked with Node.js 24.19.0:

- `npm run check`: passed.
- `npm test`: 9 tests passed, covering approval/expiry/current-content checks, required history, explicit-reference containment, Filipino keyword retrieval, and embedding-space fingerprints.
- `npm run build`: passed; the production frontend compiles.
- SQLite migration: executed in memory with Python's SQLite; Filipino FTS matching, insert/update/delete triggers, embedding revision separation, foreign-key guards, and cascading cleanup passed.
- `npm run tauri info`: configuration recognized. Native tests were not run on the original Linux preparation host. [GitHub Checks run 37913994204](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/actions/runs/37913994204), for commit `52208c6ded13c515ade8d438a27ec58ba0012931`, passed frontend checks and native `cargo test` on Windows and macOS. CI did not build/install consumer bundles or exercise local inference and full offline workflows.
- The original browser attempt could not start. A later visual/interaction review on 2026-10-09 used headless Windows Edge at 1366×768, 1024×768 and 390×844 against the browser fixtures. Search, Organize, Summarize and Ask & Act rendered without horizontal page overflow or JavaScript exceptions; Escape closed the assistant and restored focus. Readability, layout, hidden search evidence and cross-workflow notice defects remain tracked in [UI replacement #6](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/issues/6) and [workflow UI #7](https://github.com/duckycodess/folio/issues/7). This did not verify native folder picking, inference, writes or installers.

### Native workspace and index (issue #3, 2026-10-09)

Checked on Windows 11 (x64) with Rust 1.91.1 and Node.js 20.20.2 (below the 22.12 engines baseline; CI uses 22), after merging the frozen contract from `main`:

- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: 112 passed, 4 ignored (TJ's three pending native-writer cases and the PDF-fixture generator), including TJ's review repros for reused chunk ids and their cross-platform counterparts for stale retries and unreadable folders (the Unix `chmod` versions run in CI on macOS), a decompression bomb, PDF pages that cannot be extracted, accent-folded excerpts, duplicates above 20 MiB and the 5,000-document limit. The index tests cover migrations/FTS5, UTF-8 byte offsets that slice the file bytes on non-ASCII text and name its revision, PDF per-page extraction, scanned and corrupt PDFs, an unchanged second scan, external edit/delete invalidation (chunks, relationships, caches, vectors), stale-on-failure, hidden/dependency/symlink exclusion, an escaping symlink read (it actually ran on this Windows host), `..`/absolute paths, lost folders, cancellation, progress phases, link evidence (including the copy's broken link), byte-verified duplicates, restart persistence and reopen, and embedding-space isolation.
- `npm run check`, `npm test` (85 passed, 16 pending `todo`), `npm run build`: passed after the additive index types and adapter functions.
- `npm run tauri dev` on Windows: the app boots and creates `folio.sqlite` (plus WAL files) in `%APPDATA%\dev.folio.desktop`. The folder picker, scan and search were not exercised through the real window, since that needs a person at the dialog.
- Not run: any macOS native test. macOS relies on the CI `desktop-check` job.

Local inference, filesystem apply/undo, native packaging, and actual performance/size measurements remain unverified and unimplemented as described above. Indexing time and database size have not been measured.

## Product-context refresh

On 2026-10-09, the user confirmed the settled scope and authorized Impeccable init plus a direct main-branch push. The existing `docs/product.md` was updated in place with product-schema version 1, the webview platform classification, users, purpose, positioning, operating context, evidence, product principles and accessibility requirements. No competing root `PRODUCT.md` or replacement visual world was created.

The named team plan now gives TJ most checking and integration/release coordination, Dann local AI, Gab native workspace/actions and Louise the replacement UI. The full MVP and current UI replacement remain implementation work; this documentation refresh does not complete any of those features.

Documentation-refresh validation passed: Impeccable product schema 1 and the webview platform value, all 15 local Markdown references, preservation of the four original scope sections, named ownership and all ten issue links, and Prettier formatting for the three changed documentation files. Application and native tests were not rerun for this documentation-only refresh.
